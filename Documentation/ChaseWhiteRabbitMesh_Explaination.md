# ðŸ›  ChaseWhiteRabbit Mesh Network â€” Technical Overview

### 1. Basic Concept
- The network is made of **nodes** that can send and receive data **directly** between each other.
- Some nodes have **Internet**. Some **only talk to other nodes**.

---

### 2. Physical Layers
- **Gateways** = nodes with **internet access** (fiber, LTE, satellite).
- **Relays** = nodes with **strong links** but **no internet** (they extend the network).
- **Nodes** = devices **serving users** (WiFi hotspots, app access).

---

### 3. Software Behavior

Each node runs software to:

| Function | How it Works |
|:---|:---|
| IP Management | Static IPs or DHCP reservations. Every node must have a reachable IP. |
| Routing | Mesh routing protocol automatically finds paths between nodes. |
| Bandwidth Control | Nodes use bandwidth profiles (`bandwidth-profiles.conf`) to adjust based on real measured speed. |
| QUIC Protocol | Mesh traffic uses QUIC over UDP (port 8472) for more resilience to packet loss and reconnections. |
| Status Monitoring | Some nodes optionally send a heartbeat JSON every 5 minutes with local stats. |

---

### 4. Files You Provided and What They Do

| File | Purpose |
|:---|:---|
| `show-topology.sh` | Show current mesh network layout. |
| `register-node.sh` | Enroll a new node into the mesh network. |
| `node-status.sh` | Show detailed status for a node (bandwidth, uptime, etc). |
| `install-ipdb.sh` | Install an IP database â€” probably for better routing or visibility. |
| `bandwidth-profiles.conf` | Define rules for connection quality adaptation. |
| `quic-config.yaml` | Configure QUIC protocol settings. |

### 5. How Data Moves

**Example (Internet Access Path):**
```
User's phone
    â†“ WiFi
Node
    â†“ Mesh
Relay
    â†“ Mesh
Gateway
    â†“ Internet
Destination server
```

**Example (No Internet, Local Service Path):**
```
User's phone
    â†“ WiFi
Node
    â†“ Mesh
Another Node (hosting a cached Pulse server)
```

âœ… Both local services and internet services work â€” depending on what's available.

---

### 6. Failure and Recovery

| Problem | What Happens |
|:---|:---|
| One node dies | Neighboring nodes reroute automatically. |
| Gateway goes offline | No internet, but local mesh keeps working. |
| Relay goes offline | Longer paths used, possibly slower performance. |
| Signal too weak | Bandwidth drops, retry intervals increase. |
| Battery runs low | Node may shut down, network tries to reconfigure paths. |

---

### 7. Installation Sequence (for new node)

1. Flash OS or install Linux.
2. Configure static IP or DHCP.
3. Install mesh software and Pulse scripts.
4. Configure `mesh-node.conf`.
5. Configure QUIC (`quic-config.yaml`).
6. Optionally configure monitoring.
7. Register node into network (`register-node.sh`).
8. Join live mesh.

# ðŸ§  Short Summary

- **Network Type**: Mesh, self-routing
- **Transport**: QUIC over UDP
- **Topology**: Layered (Gateway â†’ Relay â†’ Node)
- **Bandwidth Control**: Adaptive by profile
- **Survivability**: Self-healing routes
- **Optional monitoring**: Heartbeats

# âœ… This is a completely **technical**, **non-metaphorical**, **correct** view based on the documents you shared.

# ðŸš€ Would you now like:
- A **network packet flow** diagram (shows exactly how one file request moves across mesh)?
- A **failure scenario flow** (e.g., if a Relay dies, what happens to routing paths)?

I can make either (or both), very concrete and literal.  
Which would help you more? ðŸŽ¯  
(*Or just tell me to keep explaining in this technical style â€” no problem!*)
