Awesome — let's go **pure technical** again:

# 🧠 Do All Routers Do This "Auto-Rerouting" Thing?

**Answer: No.**

| Router Type | Does it auto-find new paths? | Notes |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Home WiFi Router (basic ISP modem) | ❌ No | Fixed path: your device → modem → ISP. If something breaks, connection just dies. |
| Enterprise Routers (Cisco, Juniper) | ✅ Yes (but needs config) | Big routers can re-route using OSPF, BGP etc, but not by default. |
| Mesh Network Systems (like yours) | ✅ Yes (designed to!) | Mesh routing protocols (e.g., B.A.T.M.A.N., OLSR, Babel) **auto-detect and re-route** when needed. |

✅ Your **mesh network** **does auto-pathfinding**.  
❌ A normal cheap router **does not**.

# 📋 How Auto-Routing *Really* Works (Technical Diagram)

This is based on **ETX** (Expected Transmission Count) and **ETT** (Expected Transmission Time).  
You don't need to memorize names — just know **what they measure**.

# 📈 Link Cost Calculation Diagram

```
(Node A) --- good link (cost 1.1) ---> (Node B)
(Node A) --- weak link (cost 4.5) ---> (Node C)
(Node B) --- good link (cost 1.0) ---> (Gateway)
(Node C) --- bad link (cost 6.0) ---> (Gateway)
```

| Step | What Happens |
|:---|:---|
| Node A wants to reach Gateway. |
| It checks link costs: A→B is 1.1, A→C is 4.5. |
| B→Gateway is 1.0, C→Gateway is 6.0. |
| A→B→Gateway total cost = **2.1** (good). |
| A→C→Gateway total cost = **10.5** (bad). |
| ✅ Therefore, Node A picks path A→B→Gateway. |

**Meaning:**  
Lower total cost = preferred route.

# 🛠 What ETX and ETT Actually Are:

| Term | What It Means | Simple |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **ETX** (Expected Transmission Count) | How many tries needed to send a packet successfully. | High packet loss = high ETX (bad). |
| **ETT** (Expected Transmission Time) | How long it takes to send a packet. | High delay or slow bandwidth = high ETT (bad). |

✅ Nodes **exchange ETX/ETT info** with neighbors every few seconds.  
✅ Routing tables update automatically based on best total cost.

# 🧨 Failure Scenario Diagram (When a Link Dies)

Before failure:
```
(Node A) → (Node B) → (Gateway)
```
- Link A→B cost = 1.1
- Link B→Gateway cost = 1.0

After Node B fails:
- Node A can't reach Node B.
- Node A re-evaluates other paths.
- Finds Node C still alive but worse:
```
(Node A) → (Node C) → (Gateway)
```
- Link A→C cost = 4.5
- Link C→Gateway cost = 6.0

✅ Routing switches automatically after detection (~5–30 seconds).

# 🎛️ Tuning Mesh Healing (Fast vs Slow Switching)

**In routing daemons**, you usually have tuning options:

| Parameter | Effect | Recommendation for you |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Hello Interval** | How often nodes say \"I’m alive\". | Lower = faster detection, more bandwidth use. |
| **Link Timeout** | How quickly a dead link is considered \"down.\" | Lower = faster rerouting, riskier with weak links. |
| **Penalty Factors** | How much bad links are penalized. | Higher = prefer stable links aggressively. |

---

# 📜 Practical Tuning Example for Your Mesh

If you use something like B.A.T.M.A.N. Advanced:

```bash
batctl it 1000
batctl o
```
- `it` = interval time = 1000 ms (1 second)
- `o` = show originator table (neighbor info)

**Or in OLSR/Babel:**

Edit config:
```
HelloInterval 2.0   # say hello every 2 seconds
TcInterval    5.0   # topology control packets every 5 seconds
DeadTime     10.0   # consider dead if no hello for 10 sec
```

✅ This makes failures detected within 5–10 seconds usually.

# ✍️ Short Real Answer You Can Give Someone

> "Our mesh network constantly measures how well nodes can talk. If a link gets worse or fails, the network automatically switches to another path in a few seconds, picking the fastest and most reliable way."

✅ Precise.  
✅ No metaphors.  
✅ Technically true.

Would you also like me to show you **how a routing table actually looks in real mesh nodes**?  
(Example: seeing Node IDs, Link Costs, Next Hops — very useful to understand failures and performance.)  

**Literal, example outputs, you can recognize and explain.**
