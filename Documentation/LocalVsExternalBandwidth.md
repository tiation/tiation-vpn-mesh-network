# ⚡ Now — Your Important Bandwidth Question:

> **Does it matter if the traffic is 'internal' (local) vs 'external' (Internet)?**

### Literal technical answer:
✅ YES, it matters **a lot**.

| Type of Traffic | Uses Internet Quota? | Notes |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Local / Internal (Mesh traffic)** | ❌ No | Traffic stays inside the mesh. No ISP involved. |
| **External (Internet traffic)** | ✅ Yes | Counts against data caps (ISP charges). |

# 🧠 **Why Local is Safer and Cheaper**

- **All routing hello messages, heartbeat monitoring, file sharing within mesh** → **DOES NOT** use Internet quota.
- **Only pulling from the outside world** (websites, videos, updates) → **uses Internet data**.

✅ That’s why **local caching** (e.g., Pulse content, cached Wikipedia, OpenStreetMaps) is **critical** — users can **stay productive even without burning bandwidth**.

✅ You can **build entire offline networks** where *only admin maintenance needs internet* sometimes.

---

# ✨ Real Example:

- Local Chat App (e.g., Briar) → 0 GB/month Internet used.
- Local Wikipedia (kiwix-serve) → 0 GB/month Internet used.
- Accessing YouTube videos live → 2–4 GB/hour (expensive!)

---

# 🚨 **Cost Planning Tip:**

✅ **Encourage heavy content to be local.**  
✅ **Restrict internet-heavy services when data is limited.**  
✅ **Use Pulse, cached sites, and offline apps as \"primary services\" first.**

---

# 🛠 TL;DR
- Routing and heartbeat = very low cost ✅
- Local mesh services = no internet cost ✅
- Only user direct Internet traffic uses GB ✅
- Cheap nodes are absolutely possible ✅

Would you like me to help you design a "**Local First Service Plan**" for your mesh?  
(*e.g., what services you should run locally first, how to structure content caches, what's realistic on cheap devices?*)  

It would make your network 10x cheaper and more sustainable 🚀
