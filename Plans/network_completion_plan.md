### Plan to Complete the Missing Network Project Components

1. **Create Required Documentation Directories & Base Content**  
   - Make directories under /opt/mesh-network/docs/{tutorials,videos,cheatsheets}.  
   - For each new directory, add placeholder README files (e.g., README.md) and base content as per DEPLOYMENT.md.

2. **Add Missing Scripts**  
   - Implement each script referenced in DEPLOYMENT.md (e.g., mesh-config-check, mesh-apply-profile, etc.) within a unified scripts/ or bin/ directory.  
   - Ensure each script is executable and includes usage instructions/comments.

3. **Create System Service Files**  
   - Create mesh-network.service, bandwidth-monitor.service, and node-watchdog.service under a services/ directory (e.g., in systemd/ or services/).  
   - Include proper [Unit], [Service], and [Install] sections.  
   - Document how to enable, start, and monitor each service.

4. **Create Export-Ready Index & Additional Missing Documentation**  
   - Generate PROJECTS_INDEX.md (export-ready) as required by README.md.  
   - Create create-test-env.sh to set up a local or containerized environment for testing.  
   - Add validate-config.sh for verifying configuration files or environment variables before deployment.

5. **Advance Configuration Files**  
   - Complete bandwidth profiles under performance_optimization/.  
   - Add encryption key management scripts (e.g., key generation, key rotation) under a secure directory like keys/.  
   - Provide .env.example templates for various deployment scenarios, placing them in a standard location (e.g., root of the project or a config/ folder).

6. **Quality Assurance Checks**  
   - Add test scripts to validate node configurations (place them in tests/ or a dedicated QA folder).  
   - Provide sample configuration templates for different deployment scenarios in config/templates/.  
   - Include preview or template files for monitoring dashboards.

7. **Security Components**  
   - Add security hardening scripts (e.g., firewall rules, SSH configuration checks).  
   - Create key rotation and management tools (complementing the encryption scripts).  
   - Add access control configuration templates, documenting recommended best practices.

8. **Organize and Finalize**  
   - Ensure each of the above new files and directories fits into the existing directory structure consistently.  
   - Place this plan and any additional outlines in a dedicated Plans directory to keep organizational clarity.

### Next Steps
After implementing each piece:
- Verify functionality of scripts and services on a test environment.  
- Update relevant documentation with final usage examples.  
- Confirm all .env.example files and config templates align with real infrastructure setups.
